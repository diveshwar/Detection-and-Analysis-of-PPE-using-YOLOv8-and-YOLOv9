# Detection-and-Analysis-of-PPE-using-YOLOv8-and-YOLOv9
This project focuses on detecting Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) using deep learning-based object detection models, specifically YOLOv8 and YOLOv9. The aim is to enhance workplace safety by automating PPE compliance monitoring in construction sites.
Features
YOLOv8 & YOLOv9 Implementation: Comparative analysis of both models for PPE detection.
Dataset Processing: Image acquisition, preprocessing, and annotation using Roboflow.
Model Training & Evaluation: Performance analysis using precision, recall, F1-score, and mAP.
Real-Time Detection: Optimized for real-time object detection applications.
Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow & PyTorch
OpenCV
Roboflow
Google Colab & Amazon SageMaker
Results
YOLOv9 demonstrated slightly better accuracy, while YOLOv8 had superior inference speed, making it more suitable for real-time applications.
